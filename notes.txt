- Selected experience and specializations
- Biggest Project I am working on right now
- Summary of skills

Subpages
- Brief page-relevant intro
- Header: Project 1 / Research 1 / Interest 1
- text
- Image to the right of text (how can I make a slideshow for projects?)

- Books that I'm reading page? or just top 1-3 on additional interests?
