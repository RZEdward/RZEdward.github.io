Everything I get up to in my spare time!

<h2> Reading </h2>

Recently I've read a range of books, from dark/high fantasy, to a history of ribosome research, and a classic from Dostoevsky!

<h2> Travelling </h2>

In the past year I have been fortunate enough to visit Milan and experience the San Siro, see family in the UAE and attend the Abu Dhabi GP, and soon I will fly to Japan to see all from Tokyo to Osaka! I am on a mission to visit every sovereign nation, and so far I am through 41 of 197.

<h2> Cinema & TV, Musicals & Theatre </h2>

So of my recent watches, The Red Turtle is a non-verbal masterpiece, and was the last of all Studio Ghibli movies I was yet to watch. Hamilton, at the Victoria Palace Theatre, was the first musical I had been to see in-person in years, and I imagine I will soon be back again. Finally, most people will not need me to explain Saltburn... it began as a warm reflection of my time at university, and quickly descended into madness.

<h2> Ancient History </h2>

I have found myself to be somewhat obsessed with the ongoing attempts to decode the Harappan Script, an early written language of the Indus Valley Civilization. I was hoping to use my own ideas of machine learning techniques to tackle the problem, and quickly realised that cryptographers and highly-regarded professors had already been trying to do so for years... Anyway I continue to read about the Sumerians, Harappans, and other early civilisations out of pure fascination.

<h2> Sport </h2>

I grew up with football and skiing as my primary sports, and managed to reach a fairly high level in both while time and health permitted. Now I am focusing on preparing for an Ironman in 2026, and as a spectator I hold an interest in basketball, formula 1, and tennis. In time I will track my running, swimming, and cycling progression here.
