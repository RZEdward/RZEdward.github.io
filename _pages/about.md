<br>
My core interests lie in mathematics, statistics, finance, and model development, and I have developed a range of technical skills in the fields of data science, data engineering, and machine learning, through personal projects, work history, and self-study. In addition, I hold a Master's degree from Durham University in Biology and Physics within the Natural Sciences programme (Master's project completed within Computational Physics department).

In recent times I have particularly enjoyed exploring the theory and application of convolutional neural networks.

<!-- <h2> Selected Experience </h2>

**Kubrick Group - Data Engineer (Awaiting Start)**

Here, my focus early on will be on internal projects and comprehensive training in data modelling, databases, cloud engineering, cyber security, and more. From then on I will begin to engage with clients as a consultant in the broad field of data engineering, data science, and machine learning where I will have the opportunity to transform businesses and optimise internal pipelines.

<h2> Selected Project </h2>

**Agent-Based Model: The Collective Physics of Motile Cells in Complex Environments**

Built in C++, this computer-simulated agent-based model was developed to replicate the tissue environment observed upon wound-healing, tumour invasion, and early embryogenesis. The key focus was on the specific dynamics of tissue fingering upon migration or disassembly. We were interested in the properties of the fingers themselves, as well as the intensity of stochastic motion within a cell cluster that induces re-shaping and fingering as the cells spread into local space. The final paper may be seen [HERE](/files/Computational_Physics_Thesis.pdf) as a PDF.

<!--My natural sciences background has given me a concrete foundation in advanced mathematics and statistics which is crucial in understanding machine learning theory and the wider tech domain. In addition, the time I spent undertaking individual and team research projects provided me with the core tools for data analysis, data science, and proper documentation.--> 
To reinforce my understanding of computer science, I am in the process of completing several computer science modules offered online by Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, equivalent to over one year of medium to advanced-level degree modules. Selected courses:

<!-- CS106A - Programming Methodologies 
* CS106X - Programming Abstractions
* CS107 - Computer Organisation and Systems
* CS110 - Principles of Computer Systems
* CS145 - Data Management and Data Systems 
-->
* CMU15445 - Intro to Database Systems
* CS161 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms 
* CS166 - Data Structures
* CS229 - Machine Learning
<!--
* CS229B - Machine Learning for Sequence Modelling
* CS230 - Deep Learning
* CS231N - Deep Learning for Computer Vision
-->

Please see my linked socials if you wish to contact me, and refer to the navigation bar to see my projects, research, and additional interests in depth.

<!--My career is just beginning but I have a well-defined set of goals I hope to achieve. Looking forward I will continue to develop my data engineering, data science, and machine learning skills until I am confident in the specific domain I would like to specialise in, and at present I feel drawn to reinforcement learning due to the near-infinite scale of complexity and intrigue it offers. From this point, I aim to apply innovative machine learning model solutions to change the way the world approaches problems I am passionate about. I hope to build something truly meaningful that transforms a business or industry and later submit it to a top conference where I can share my research and ideas.-->
