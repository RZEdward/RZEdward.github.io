<br>
Hello there, I'm Ross! My core interests lie in problem solving, model development, and machine learning, and so I have developed a range of technical skills in data science and wider computer science through personal projects, work history, and self-study. In addition, I hold a Master's degree from Durham University in Biology and Physics within the Natural Sciences programme (Master's project completed within the Computational Physics department). 

With experience as a Logistics Manager and as a Data Scientist, I am now looking to join an exceptional technical team solving a range of complex problems. 

Recently, I have particularly enjoyed exploring anomaly detection in energy systems, as well as SNNs, as spiking neural networks satisfy my interests in both machine learning and neuroscience.

<!-- <h2> Selected Experience </h2>

**Kubrick Group - Data Engineer (Awaiting Start)**

Here, my focus early on will be on internal projects and comprehensive training in data modelling, databases, cloud engineering, cyber security, and more. From then on I will begin to engage with clients as a consultant in the broad field of data engineering, data science, and machine learning where I will have the opportunity to transform businesses and optimise internal pipelines.

-->

<h2> Selected Project </h2>

**Agent-Based Model: The Collective Physics of Motile Cells in Complex Environments**

Built in C++, this computer-simulated agent-based model replicated the tissue environment observed upon wound-healing, tumour invasion, and early embryogenesis
Key focus: specific dynamics of tissue fingering upon collective cell migration and disassembly. The final paper may be seen [HERE](/files/Computational_Physics_Thesis.pdf) as a PDF.

<!--My natural sciences background has given me a concrete foundation in advanced mathematics and statistics which is crucial in understanding machine learning theory and the wider tech domain. In addition, the time I spent undertaking individual and team research projects provided me with the core tools for data analysis, data science, and proper documentation.--> 
To reinforce my understanding of computer science, I have spent my free time formally studying core topics such as databases, data structures & algorithms, and machine learning, through online lectures.

Please see my linked socials if you wish to contact me, and refer to the navigation bar to see my projects, research, and additional interests in depth.

<!--My career is just beginning but I have a well-defined set of goals I hope to achieve. Looking forward I will continue to develop my data engineering, data science, and machine learning skills until I am confident in the specific domain I would like to specialise in, and at present I feel drawn to reinforcement learning due to the near-infinite scale of complexity and intrigue it offers. From this point, I aim to apply innovative machine learning model solutions to change the way the world approaches problems I am passionate about. I hope to build something truly meaningful that transforms a business or industry and later submit it to a top conference where I can share my research and ideas.-->
