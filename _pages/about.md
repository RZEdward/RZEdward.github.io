Welcome to my personal website and portfolio, my name is Ross, I'm an incoming machine learning engineer, and I am a graduate of Durham University with a Master's degree in Natural Sciences combining Physics and Biology. I am driven by a deep interest in mathematics, statistics, and model development, and I have developed a range of technical skills in the field of machine learning and data science through personal projects, work history, and self-study.

Entering the tech world from a natural sciences background has given me a concrete foundation in advanced mathematics and statistics which I can apply to machine learning theory. In addition, the significant time I have spent undertaking research projects has given me a deep appreciation for data analysis, data science, and proper documentation. To reinforce my 'transition' from physics to computer science, I have completed several computer science modules offered online by Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, equivalent to over one year of medium to advanced level degree modules:

* CS106A / CS106X - Programming Methodologies / Programming Abstractions
* CS107 / CS110 - Computer Organisation and Systems / Principles of Computer Systems
* CS145 / CMU15445 - Data Management and Data Systems / Intro to Database Systems
* CS161 / CS166 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms / Data Structures
* CS228 - Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques
* CS229 / CS229B - Machine Learning / Machine Learning for Sequence Modelling
* CS230 - Deep Learning

My career is just beginning but I have a well-defined set of goals I hope to achieve. Looking forward I will continue to develop my machine learning skills until I am confident in the subset of machine learning I would like to specialise in, and at present I feel drawn to reinforcement learning due to the near-infinite scale of complexity and intrigue it offers. From this point, I aim to apply innovative machine learning solutions to transform businesses and optimise key processes and pipelines. I hope to build something truly meaningful and later submit it to a top conference where I can share my research and ideas.
