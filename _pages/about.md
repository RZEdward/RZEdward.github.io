<br>
Incoming machine learning engineer at Kubrick Group and graduate of Durham University with a Master's degree in Natural Sciences combining Physics and Biology. 

I am driven by a deep interest in mathematics, statistics, and model development, and I have developed a range of technical skills in the field of machine learning and data science through personal projects, work history, and self-study. 

My current research interests lie in RNNs, agent-based modelling, and time series forecasting. 

<h3> Skills & Certifications </h3>

* Python / C++ / R / Shell-Scripting
* Tableau / PowerBI
* SQL (PostgreSQL)
* Advanced Excel / Microsoft Office
* AWS / Azure
* Hadoop / Spark

Selected experience:

* Kubrick Group - Machine Learning Engineer
* Here my primary focus has been on...

Primary Ongoing Project:

* Custom-built neural network designed to identify pokemon

Recent conferences, talks, workshops, and networking events attended:

* NIPS

My natural sciences background has given me a concrete foundation in advanced mathematics and statistics which can be applied to machine learning theory and the wider tech domain. In addition, the significant time I have spent undertaking research projects has given me a deep appreciation for data analysis, data science, and proper documentation. 

To reinforce my 'transition' from physics to computer science, I have completed several computer science modules offered online by Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, equivalent to over one year of medium to advanced-level degree modules:

* CS106A / CS106X - Programming Methodologies / Programming Abstractions
* CS107 / CS110 - Computer Organisation and Systems / Principles of Computer Systems
* CS145 / CMU15445 - Data Management and Data Systems / Intro to Database Systems
* CS161 / CS166 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms / Data Structures
* CS228 - Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques
* CS229 / CS229B - Machine Learning / Machine Learning for Sequence Modelling
* CS230 - Deep Learning

My career is just beginning but I have a well-defined set of goals I hope to achieve. Looking forward I will continue to develop my machine learning skills until I am confident in the subset of machine learning I would like to specialise in, and at present I feel drawn to reinforcement learning due to the near-infinite scale of complexity and intrigue it offers. From this point, I aim to apply innovative machine learning solutions to transform businesses and optimise key processes and pipelines. I hope to build something truly meaningful and later submit it to a top conference where I can share my research and ideas.
