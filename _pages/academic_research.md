Welcome to my research page. I am yet to formally publish any research, but below I will display reimplementations of advanced papers, summaries of interesting publications, and my final year dissertations.

<h2> Agent-Based Model: The Collective Physics of Motile Cells in Complex Environments </h2>

Built in C++, this computer-simulated agent-based model was developed to replicate the tissue environment observed upon wound-healing, tumour invasion, and early embryogenesis. The key focus was on the specific dynamics of tissue fingering upon migration or disassembly. We were interested in the properties of the fingers themselves, as well as the intensity of stochastic motion within a cell cluster that induces re-shaping and fingering as the cells spread into local space. The final paper may be seen [HERE](/files/Computational_Physics_Thesis.pdf) as a PDF.

<h2> The Emergent Role of Epigenetic and Environmental Factors in Promoting Neural Tube Defects </h2>

This literature review, accessed [HERE](/files/Biosciences_Literature_Review.pdf) as a PDF, is a synthesis of various papers exploring the ways in which the dysregulation of epigenetic processes or imbalance of environmental factors may lead to the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs).
