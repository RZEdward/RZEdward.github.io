Welcome to my research section. At present, I am yet to formally publish any research, but below I will display reimplementations of advanced papers, summaries of interesting publications, and my final year biosciences literature review.

<h2> Agent-Based Model: The Collective Physics of Motile Cells in Complex Environments </h2>

Built in C++, this computer-simulated agent-based model was developed to replicate the tissue environment observed upon wound-healing, tumour invasion, and early embryogenesis. The key focus was on the specific dynamics of cell cluster fingering upon migration or disassembly. We were interested in the properties of the fingers themselves, as well as the intensity of stochastic motion within a cell cluster that induces re-shaping and fingering as the cells spread into local space. Although my results are protected due to ongoing related research, I can share the replicated results of relevant papers studied during my literature review.
