<h2> Convolutional Neural Network: Gen-1 Pok√©mon Classifier </h2>

In my most recent project I constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras from TensorFlow and applied it to a dataset of first generation pokemon (downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification/data)), with the aim of producing an accurate image recognition algorithm and correctly classifying pokemon when tested on unseen data.

Following some intensive efforts in preprocessing, hidden layer selections, and hyperparameter optimization, the model returns a training accuracy of 95% after 20 epochs, having resized images to 256x256. However, the testing accuracy was considerably lower, and so I will soon introduce anti-overfitting techniques into the algorithm in order to enhance generalisation to unseen data. The report and code will be made available upon completion.

<h2> An Insight Into London's Boroughs: Rental Market and Lifestyle </h2>

In this project I conducted extensive research into various key stats that one might consider before moving to London, and presented it in the form of a Tableau dashboard. Rental data was scraped from SpareRoom using Python's BeautifulSoup library, and much of the other information was sourced via downloadable CSVs (later processed using Pandas) or simply by manual copy and paste. Although a dataset of this size could have been managed in Excel, I chose to transfer it to PostgreSQL (after some data cleaning in Excel) in order to reinforce skills I had learnt during past work experience and online courses. Visit my Tableau Public [profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.edwards/vizzes) if you wish to interact with the dashboard and reveal tooltips.

<h2> Project 4: Logistic Regression </h2>

Using built-in vs custom built logistic regression to identify neural tube defects. We are taking quantifiable features of the neural tubes rather than images here.
