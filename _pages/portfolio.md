Welcome! See my projects below.

<h2> CNN Pokemon Classifier </h2>

In my most recent project I constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and applied it to a dataset of first generation pokemon, with the aim of correctly classifying a pokemon when tested on unseen data.

<h2> An Insight Into London's Boroughs: Rental Market and Lifestyle </h2>

In this project I conducted extensive research into various key stats that one might consider before moving to London, and presented it in the form of a Tableau dashboard. Rental data was scraped from SpareRoom.com using Python's BeautifulSoup library, and much of the other information was sourced via downloadable CSVs (later processed using Pandas) or simply by manual copy and paste. Although a dataset of this size could have been managed in Excel, I chose to transfer it to PostgreSQL (after some data cleaning in Excel) in order to reinforce skills I had learnt during past work experience and online courses. Visit my Tableau Public profile if you wish to interact with the dashboard and reveal tooltips.

<h2> Project 4: Logistic Regression </h2>

Using built-in vs custom built logistic regression to identify neural tube defects. We are taking quantifiable features of the neural tubes rather than images here.
