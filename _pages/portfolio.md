<h2> CNN Pokemon Classifier </h2>

In my most recent project I constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN) and applied it to a dataset of first generation pokemon, with the aim of correctly classifying a pokemon when tested on unseen data.

In addition, I was interested to see how the performance of a CNN developed from scratch would compare with that of the TensorFlow/Keras libraries. The results are summarised below, but for the complete report please click HERE.
